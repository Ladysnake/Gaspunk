# GASPUNK 1.0

#### Adds:

- Smokes/ gases / vapours: The mod centres itself around artisanal smokes, gases and vapours, produced by the corresponding grenades. Every smoke, gas or vapour is unique, with unique effects, that are applied to any entity going through them. The common property is that toxic smokes / gases suffocate entities if they go through them. The only way to counter these effects is to wear a gas mask, or just avoiding going through the gases.
- Tubes: Tubes are used to brew liquids that will result in smoke / gas / vapour when vaporized. Empty tubes can be replenished with water like bottles, and stack by 16. Non-empty tubes can be poured on the ground in order to remove their content, and stack by 16 of the same type. Obtained when dismantling an empty grenade along with a grenade diffuser.
- Grenade diffuser: Crafted with an iron ingot, leather, redstone dust and a slime ball (or magma cream), they can be combined with any non-empty tube in order to make the corresponding grenade. Can also be obtained by dismantling an empty grenade along with an empty tube.
- Grenade: Grenades are the throwable result of what you brew. They are crafted with any non-empty tube and a grenade diffuser. Once thrown, they activate after a timing of 3 seconds, whether or not theyâ€™ve hit something yet. They can be cooked (click once to unpin and throw instantaneously, or hold click to unpin and cook then release click to throw). They last 20 seconds and are not destroyed upon impact, dropping an empty unpinned grenade after the liquid has been fully consumed (after the grenade has stopped emitting). Empty grenades are not craftable, but when put in a crafting slot, allow their dismantling into an empty vapour tube and a grenade diffuser. Empty grenades stack by 16, non-empty ones by 1.
- Smoke powder: Crafted with sugar and gunpowder, smoke powder is the element to brew in a water tube in order to produce a simple smoke tube.
- Ash: Obtained by smelting zombie flesh or nether wart in a furnace. Used to brew toxic gas. The recipe with zombie flesh can be disabled in the configuration options in order to avoid conflicts.
- Gasmask: The gasmask is a helmet piece of gear that allow breathing in smokes / gases / vapours, therefore countering their effects. Armour rate and durability same as leather helmet.

- Grenade belt: The grenade belt is an additional gear for Baubles. It changes the max grenade stacking from 1 to 4 of the same type when equipped.

#### Smokes:

- Simple smoke (white) / Coloured smoke: Simple smoke to block the view of enemy players.The simple smoke (white variant obtained when brewing smoke powder in a water tube) can be coloured by brewing any dye in it, resulting in a smoke of that same colour (coloured smoke).
- Toxic smoke: Obtained by brewing ash in a simple smoke tube, this smoke suffocates the player when his oxygen bar depletes.

#### Gases:

-         
  Invisible gas (sarin): Obtained by brewing a poisonous potato into a water tube, this gas is living up to its name. It's totally invisible and undetectable, unless you're inside it. Suffocates entities going through it.
-         Teargas: Slows the player and blurs its vision

#### Vapours:

-         Vapour: Similar to smoke, vapour does nothing apart from creating a cloud. It is obtained when a water grenade is thrown.
-         Healing vapour: Vapour granting any entity breathing it (by getting inside) a regeneration I effect. Obtained by brewing a ghast tear in a water tube.
